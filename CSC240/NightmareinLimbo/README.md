# Nightmare-in-Limbo
Hello there!

This is a text-based adventure game that I made in two days without knowing C++.
I might update this at some point in the future. This can be compiled using GCC GNU compiler 
in the command prompt, or just by using the exe file if you're only interested in playing it.
